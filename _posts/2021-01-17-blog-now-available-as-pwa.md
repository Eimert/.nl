I'm excited to announce that something I've wanted for a long time is now finally there (and works 'good enough' for now :blush:).
I've added PWA capabilities to this blog (hosted on Github-pages). This website is now installable and the (refreshed!) icon will sit among other apps.

The thing that is not yet working as desired are the offline capabilities. It's only possible to see pages that have already been visited; unvisited pages wil give a 404.
I'm going to find out a solution for this. [Kurt Lourens](https://kurtlourens.com/) has been a major source of inspiration to make this blog available as a PWA.
