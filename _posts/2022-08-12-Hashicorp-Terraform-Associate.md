On the 12th of August 2022 I passed the [Hashicorp Terraform Associate](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate) exam!
A nice way to formalize years of experience both hobby and work related with this certification. Suffice to say I'm very excited about using Terraform for IaC and automated public and private cloud provisioning.
