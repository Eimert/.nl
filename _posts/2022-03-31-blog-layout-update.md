The Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme skin [contrast](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#contrast-skin-contrast){:target="_blank"} has been replaced with [sunrise](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#sunrise-skin-sunrise){:target="_blank"}. 

#### Why?
I find the contrast skin is too sterile, the red underline animation when hovering over menu items is too bright, too loud, too much screaming to me. The <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span> blog post headers weren't matching with anything else, thus not harmonious with the rest of the colors.  

#### The new skin
The sunrise skin looks more cozy, friendly and inviting imho. The blog posts headers are <span style="color:#e3344a">**pink**</span> or red and matching with the menu items. I feel this new skin better conveys how I want to present myself online. I didn't do much blogging last year, this new skin is a good motivation to start writing again.

#### More updates
I've redesigned the showcase (its now called work), about and contact pages. Also made a separate page for certifications. Footer is also updated. I'm happy with the new version of the site. Send me a message to let me know what you think.
