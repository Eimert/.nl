My top ten talks from the [GOTO software development conference in Amsterdam](https://gotoams.nl){:target="_blank"}, 17-20 June 2019.
Most of the talks have been recorded and (will be) published on the [GotoConferences youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GotoConferences/videos){:target="_blank"}.

## 1) [Extreme Digitalization in China](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/1060){:target="_blank"}
I'm impressed by the advances China is making in terms of digitisation. Take WeChat for example, with sub-programmes such as
CoffeeBox that have gained tremendous popularity. Payments using face recognition are now commonplace in China, while I 
haven't seen this happening (yet) here in The Netherlands. China has a very competitive start-up scene, with long workdays 
(9-21h, 6 days a week). The competition is fierce, and ideas are copied by competitors. Businesses *have* to be the first, 
it does not matter if a product is only partially finished.  

## 2) [Machine Ethics](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/782){:target="_blank"}
This talk by Nell Watson gives an update on the latest developments in AI.

## 3) [Energy and Education Access for Remote Communities](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/757){:target="_blank"}
This keynote was touching because it shows how much the quality of life could be improved by simply installing proper 
solar panels and lighting in remote (Himalayan) mountain villages.

## 4) [Augmented Reality, Beyond Virtual Objects Floating in Physical Space](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/785){:target="_blank"}
This talk gave me new ideas for applying augmented reality in software.

## 5) [Building a Cloud-native Event-driven Microservice Platform for Crypto Currency Trading with Spring Webflux](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/752){:target="_blank"}
Erwin de Gier explained how he built BLOX, a cryptocurrency trading platform using reactive technology (Spring Webflux) 
in a microservices architecture. 

## 6) [Boost your API Development with GraphQL & Prisma](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/784){:target="_blank"}
Graph databases are new and promising technologies. 

## 7) [Taking Security Seriously](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/1077){:target="_blank"}
Finally a security talk that is enjoyable. Philippe gives several case studies, one is showing the fragility of open source software development.

## 8) [Event-Driven Microservices, the Sense, the Non-sense and a Way Forward](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/862){:target="_blank"}
Allard, creator of the Axon framework, provides some common sense for developers on how to go about an event-driven microservice architecture.

## 9) [Innovate using Machine Learning and AI](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/861){:target="_blank"}
Altough this is a subtle sales talk/showcase of the AI capabilities offered by AWS, it inspired me with new ideas for new functionalities in apps.

## 10) [How we Built Google Tulip by using Serverless Technology and Machine Learning](https://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/1070){:target="_blank"}
Google Tulip was the April fools' day joke of 2019 by Google (in The Netherlands). The team gave an energetic and 
humorous presentation. [_"Looking forward for bouquet scanning capabilities"_](https://twitter.com/EimertVink/status/1141637923873415168){:target="_blank"}
