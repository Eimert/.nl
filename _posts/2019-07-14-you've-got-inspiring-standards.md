## Programmer competency matrix
Introducing [Sijin Joseph's programmer competency matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/){:target="_blank"}.
This matrix describes four levels of programming skills. It tremendously helps me to assess my current level, to easily see the next level, and how to achieve it. A few remarks:
- Outdated technologies: CVS and SVN version control systems have been replaced with GIT.
- Centered on 'hard skills'; no mentioning of soft-skills, teamwork, etc.
- Agile skills could also be measured, but there is no mentioning of that (linked to outdated).


## Standards
IMHO life is about practising, learning, growing and trusting the process in a continuous fashion in order to raise my personal standards. 
Whichever standard it is, it is something I can measure and grow towards.

A few inspirational video's about standards:

## European e-Competence Framework
[This framework](http://www.ecompetences.eu/e-cf-overview/){:target="_blank"} could be used to assess (IT) competency within organisations. There are four dimensions, 40 competencies, and 
[30 ICT professional role profiles](http://www.ecompetences.eu/ict-professional-profiles/){:target="_blank"}.

## Other IT competency frameworks
This blogpost features two frameworks, I know there are several frameworks out there. I use these frameworks to grow to the next level.

Ask yourself: what is the level I am currently playing at? On what level do I hold myself accountable for? Go and do the work ðŸ’ª.
