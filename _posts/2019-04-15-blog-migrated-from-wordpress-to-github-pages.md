I've decided to put my [wordpress blog](https://eimert.tech.blog){:target="_blank"} in 'read-only' mode. Future posts
will be on this new [github pages](https://eimert.github.io/.nl) blog.

## The why
I've decided to use github pages for mainly two reasons:
1. performance (faster page loading)
2. free of advertising.

## Old wordpress blog
The [old wordpress blog](https://eimert.tech.blog){:target="_blank"} will still be available but no longer updated.
Thank you wordpress.com for serving my blog from January 2014 onwards.

## Link migration
Link migration seem only possible using wordpress plugins, that require a paid wordpress.com plan.

## HTTPS
Github needs 24h to setup HTTPS for this domain.
